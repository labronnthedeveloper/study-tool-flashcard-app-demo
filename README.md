# Project: Flashcard-o-matic
A local school has decided to put together a flashcard application, Flashcard-o-matic, to help their students study online. Teachers will use this application to create decks of flashcards for the subjects they teach, and students will study the decks. 
Features include deck/card creation, editing decks/cards, deleting decks/cards, viewing cards and study-mode which allows a start-to-finish walkthrough of cards within the deck.
